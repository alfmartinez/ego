# Ego Game Engine

Ego is a Game Engine written in Go. 
The goal of this project is to provide building blocks needed to build all sorts of different game, from adventure text games and 2D platformers to MMORPGs (I hope one day).

## Structure of workspace
The workspace is divided into several modules:
- engine : contains building blocks, and basic architecture,
- examples : contains example games used to illustrate usage,
- shared : contains usual implementations of building blocks,
- tools : contains useful tools to help create games.
