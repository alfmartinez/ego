"Bic" 

The Staff Break Room is a room. "A nice break room. To take breaks."

The player carries an orange, a Bic pen, and a napkin. 
The description of the orange is "It's as samll hard pinch-skinned thing from the lunch room, probably with lots of pips and no juice."

The description of the napkin is "Slightly crumpled".

Test me with "examine orange" "examine pen" "examine napkin" "look"
