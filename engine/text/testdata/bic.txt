"Bic" 

The Staff Break Room is a room.

The player carries an orange, a Bic pen, and a napkin. 
The description of the orange is "It's as samll hard pinch-skinned thing from the lunch room, probably with lots of pips and no juice."

The description of the napkin is "Slightly crumpled".

Test me with "look at orange" "look at pen" "look at napkin" "look around"
